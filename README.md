# Gradebook
A distributed system in Go exploring distributed architecture, practices and workings.

- This is a hybrid-model distributed system using Go as the primary language.
- The transport layer is standard HTTP and JSON as protocol.
- Gradebook is a practice system which explores distributed architecture rather than creating the most efficient end-product.
- It helps me understand how distributed systems work, how all the services interact, and how to trace/log the services using tools.
